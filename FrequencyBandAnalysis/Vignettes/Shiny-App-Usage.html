<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Shiny App Usage</h1>



<p>This vignette serves to give a detailed explanation of how to use and
interpret this shiny application.</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Upon opening the application, the user will see two tabs at the top
of the screen- entitled “File Upload” and “Simulation Setting”. These
serve to enable the user to run these algorithms on either data that
they upload, or on some simulated data, respectively. As such, this
vignette will give a step-by-step guide on how to utilize both tabs of
this application. This vignette is broken up into 2 sections (File
Upload and Simulation Setting)- each of which has 2 subsections (Input
and Output). Each of these sections serve to give a detailed explanation
of either what needs to go into the application for the algorithm to
run, or a detailed summary of the visual results that will be given
after the algorithm runs. As such, the two input and output sections
will be very similar to one another (but not identical- hence why they
will all given below, in the sake of clarity).</p>
</div>
<div id="file-upload" class="section level1">
<h1>File Upload</h1>
<div id="file-upload--input" class="section level2">
<h2>File Upload- Input</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first step is to upload your data, which must be a CSV file.
Pressing the “Browse” button will open a file explorer that will enable
you to select your data, and upload it into the application.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If your data has column names, they will be kept and read in, so
long as you check the box next to Header prior to selecting your
data</li>
<li>The data must be entirely numeric for the algorithm to run properly.
A corresponding warning message will appear if the data that is read in
isn’t numeric.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If your data has multiple components, you will be prompted to
select whether your data is Multivariate or Functional. If your uploaded
data is Univariate, predictably, you won’t see this prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, the dimensions of your data will appear below where you
inputted the data. Additionally, for Multivariate/Functional data, there
will be a selection for whether or not you want to include 3D Plots in
the output. Next, you should choose values for each of the parameters
that you see. These will all be filled with a default value that will
work, however you can change each of these values to any number of valid
choices</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“Valid Choices” are denoted by “*’s”, and explained as a footnote.
This serves to give the absolute range of values that can be utilized,
that will still let the algorithm run. Choosing a value that is outside
of this range will either cause an error, or crash the application.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once you are finished selecting values for the options seen, you can
press the “Run” button, which will run the algorithm on your data, with
the selected values as parameters.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="file-upload--output" class="section level2">
<h2>File Upload- Output</h2>
<p>Note: For Functional/Multivariate data, while the algorithm is
running, a message will appear to tell you that you can track the
progress of the algorithm in a newly-created text file.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Once Step 2 in the File Upload- Input section above has been
completed, a plot of your data will appear in the main portion of the
application. For data with multiple components, there will be a slider
to let you scroll through each component (for multivariate data), or
through each timepoint (for functional data). All other plots will only
appear after the algorithm has finished running.</p></li>
<li><p>The next plot will differ slightly depending on what type of data
is being used</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For Univariate data, this will be a plot of the multitaper
autospectrogram, with the estimated partition points represented by a
light blue line on the corresponding frequencies This is accompanied
with a table, denoting each of the predicted frequency bands.</li>
<li>For Multivariate data, this will be a plot of the multitaper
autospectrogram, with the estimated partition points represented by a
light blue line on the corresponding frequencies This is accompanied
with a table, denoting each of the predicted frequency bands.
Additionally, there is a slider below the plot to let you view this for
every “diagonal” cross-component (such as 1-1, 2-2, etc.).</li>
<li>For Functional data, this will be a plot of the multitaper
autospectrogram, with the estimated partition points represented by a
light blue line on the corresponding frequencies This is accompanied
with a table, denoting each of the predicted frequency bands.
Additionally, there is a slider below the plot to let you view this for
every cross-component. If a “diagonal” cross-component is selected (such
as 1-1, 2-2, etc.), this plot will be the multitaper autospectrogram for
that component. If a “non-diagonal” cross-component is selected (such as
1-2, 3-1, etc.), this plot will be the signal coherence between those
two components.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Next, there may or may not be 3D Plots- as this depends on the type
of data that is being used. Additionally, these plots will not show if
you chose to exclude these 3D Plots, in an earlier mentioned
selection.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For Univariate data, there will be no 3D Plots.</li>
<li>For Multivariate data, there will be one 3D Plot. It will be a 3D
version of the multitaper autospectrogram plot seen above, but this plot
doesn’t have anything denoting the predicted significant partition
points. However, there is still a slider, to enable viewing this plot
for every “diagonal” cross-component.</li>
<li>For Functional data, there will be two 3D Plots. The first plot will
be a 3D Plot of the entire dataset. It can be seen as an amalgamation of
the first plot in this selection at every timepoint. The second plot
will be a 3D version of the multitaper autospectrogram/coherence plot
seen above, but this plot doesn’t have anything denoting the predicted
significant partition points. However, there is still a slider, to
enable viewing this plot for every cross-component.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Lastly, summary tables and a scatterplot of p-values that can be
seen.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>There is a table entitled “Summary of Partition Point Tests”- which
contains the frequency, along with its corresponding p-value, p-value
threshold, and whether or not it is a significant partition point for
every frequency deemed significant. If there were no frequencies deemed
to be significant partition points, then the table will display the
frequency that had the lowest corresponding p-value.</li>
<li>For Univariate data, there is a table entitled “Summary of testing
for Flat Spectrum in Each Segment”. This table contains information on
whether or not each predicted frequency band has a flat, or non-flat
spectrum</li>
<li>The scatterplot serves to plot the p-value for testing whether a
given frequency is a significant partition point against the frequencies
that were tested. If any frequencies were deemed to be a significant
partition point, then a vertical dashed line will be present at that
given frequency in the plot.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>At the very bottom of the page, there is a button to “Download the
Above Results”, which will download the plots and tables seen above into
a 2-page pdf file. The first page will consist of plots 1 and 2, as they
were mentioned in this section. (Note: For Multivariate/Functional data,
whichever component/timepoint you have chosen with the slider when you
press the Download button will be the component/timepoint that you will
get a plot for in the pdf). The second page will consist of the plots
and tables mentioned above in 4.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="simulation-setting" class="section level1">
<h1>Simulation Setting</h1>
<div id="simulation-setting--input" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulation Setting- Input</h2>
<p>Note: Upon coming to this tab for the first time after opening the
application, there will be some default parameters for Univariate Data
selected, and the results of running that algorithm will be given.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first step is to select the type of data that you want to use-
either Univariate, Multivariate, or Functional. This choice will change
the various parameters that can be seen below. Additionally, for
Multivariate/Functional data, there will be a selection for whether or
not you want to include 3D Plots in the output. After this, you should
choose one of the options under the Simulation Setting drop down
(Sinusoidal, Linear, etc.), as this will choose the type of simulated
data that you want to run this algorithm on.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If “White Noise” was chosen under the Simulation Setting, the data
was generated such that it will have no actual partition points.</li>
<li>If any other choice was selected under the Simulation Setting, the
data was generated such that it will have partition points at
frequencies of 0.15 Hz and 0.35 Hz.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Next, you should choose values for each of the parameters that you
see. These will all be filled with a default value that will work,
however you can change each of these values to a couple other valid,
preset choices.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“Valid Choices” are denoted by “*’s”, and explained as a footnote.
This serves to give a couple values that can work in running the
algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once you are finished selecting values for the options seen, you can
press the “Run” button, which will run the algorithm on the chosen
simulated data, with the selected values as parameters.</li>
