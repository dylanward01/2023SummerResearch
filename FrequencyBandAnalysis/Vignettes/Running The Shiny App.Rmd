```

Currently, there are 3 different ways that this application can be run (running it through R, utilizing our package, or running it through Docker). Below is a step-by-step guide for how to run this application through any of these methods. 

# 1.) Running this application through R

1. Download the FrequencyBandAnalysis folder seen in this repository.
2. Ensure that the packages listed in the app.R file are installed on your machine.
3. Proceed to run the app.R file, and wait for the application to open in a new window from your R interface.

# 2.) Running this application through our package

- The corresponding package for this application, and its associated functions is currently a work in progress. This will be updated once the package has been made.

# 3.) Running this application through Docker

1. Open your command line, and run the command docker pull dylanward01/frequencybandanalysis:0.9.1
2. After the image finishes pulling, run the command docker run -d --rm -p 3838:3838 dylanward01/frequencybandanalysis:0.9.1 (or replacing the 3838:3838 with whatever port you wish to run this application through).
3. Once that command finishes, and the application has loaded (which will take a few minutes after the command finishes), open up your favorite web browser, and type in localhost:3838 (or again replacing the 3838 if you chose a different port number), and proceed to run through and enjoy the shiny application.
